# Charity-ML
This project uses labeled individuals' income dataset collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The objective is to use several supervised algorithms to predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000. and hence whether this individual is most likely to donate to the non-profit organization or not.

# Usage:
- The project starts with Data loading and exploration
- Data preparation and processing
- Data shuffling and splitting
- This project applied 3 supervised LEarning models
-- Decision Tree Classifier
-- Support Vector Machine
-- AdaBosst Classifier
- Train the model
- Perform initial model evaluation
- Selecting best model and tune it
- Extracting feature importance
