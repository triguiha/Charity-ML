The objective is to use several supervised algorithms to predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000. and hence whether this individual is most likely to donate to the non-profit organization or not.

# Usage:
- The project starts with Data loading and exploration
- Data preparation and processing
- Data shuffling and splitting
- This project applied 3 supervised LEarning models
1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Support Vector Machine
3. AdaBosst Classifier
